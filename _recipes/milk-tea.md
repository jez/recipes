# A note on half & half

A good half and half makes or breaks a milk tea. Across all your ingredients, half and half is the one you want to skimp on the least.

I live in the SF Bay Area, and my favorite half and half is Straus Organic Half & Half. It is hard to find, but I have been able to find it at Draegers and Whole Foods in the past.

If you can't find Straus, what you want to look for is "Pasteurized" not "Ultra
Pasteurized." What's the difference?

> Many half & half products are ultra-pasteurized to increase shelf life, which
> involves “cooking” the milk at high temperature (at or above 280°F for at
> least two seconds). These more heavily processed items forfeit flavor and
> nutritional integrity in their quest for a longer shelf life.
>
> Never ultra-pasteurized. Straus Family Creamery Organic Half & Half is
> pasteurized at 170°F for 18 seconds and lightly homogenized to emulsify the
> milk and cream (to minimize separation). This process destroys harmful
> bacteria while still preserving the authentic flavor of the milk and cream.

Pasteurized half and half won't last as long as ultra-pasteurized, so you want
to double check the sell-by dates. Also in my experience not all pasteurized
half and half are created equal, and I have found some that I still didn't like
as much as Straus (or even a really good, ultra-pasteurized organic / grass fed
half and half).

**tl;dr**: The half & half is the most important ingredient. Shop around to find
your favorite.

# A note on ratios

The recipes below are all scaled for a single cup. I usually scale the recipes
up 4x if I'm experimenting and 8x if I know that my chosen amount of leaves,
temperature, and duration isn't going to end up being a waste of leaves 😅

I find it's easier to make larger batches because they come out more consistent.
Also saves time—it's great having a gallon of tea in the fridge!

# A note on tapioca pearls

There are two kinds of pearls: the "instant cook" kind and the raw, not
partially precooked kind.

All the pros will tell you that if you really want good pearls you need the raw
pearls. I don't think so. I ordered the Boba Guys' [Boba
Kit](https://www.thebobakit.com/shop) which came with some raw pearls from U.S.
Boba Company, and not only is it like a 2 hour affair to cook them, I didn't
even like the way they came out.

My favorite pearls are [E-Fa Brand Black Tapioca
Pearls](https://www.amazon.com/Fa-Brand-Bubble-Black-Tapioca/dp/B0001N7RLQ).
Amazon lists this for USD 13.50, but I regularly find them for like USD 6 when I
shop at my local 99 Ranch Market in the SF Bay Area.

I have also tried [WuFuYuan Tapioca
Pearls](https://www.amazon.com/WuFuYuan-Tapioca-Pearl-Black-Net/dp/B00PLTLG4O)
which cook a little faster but tend to feel flimsier when you chew on them,
which I don't love.

Here's how I cook the E-Fa Brand pearls:

### Ingredients

- ¼ cup pearls (makes one serving)
- 1–2 tbsp [Boba Guys House Syrup](#boba-guys-house-syrup)

### Instructions

- Wait for some water to boil in a pot (around a quart, doesn't need to be exact)
  - You want to keep a bit of a rolling boil this whole time, so that the pearls
    naturally bounce around and don't stick to each other
- Add the pearls to the boiling water, stir once to make sure they're not stuck
  on the bottom
- Wait for the pearls to float (about 30s)
- Once floating, cover pot and set timer for 8min
- When timer rings, uncover pot, stir, and cook uncovered for another 8min
- When second timer rings, drain water and rinse pearls in cold water for 20s
  - You can also let them sit in cold water in a bowl for 20s if you want
- Combine drained pearls and syrup in a bowl, let sit at room temperature for at
  least 30 minutes, up to 2 hours
- Serve in your favorite drink


# Boba Guys House Syrup

### Notes

- Originally from [*The Boba Book*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984824279), p. 27
- Yields between 2 – 2¼ cups, depending on time spent reducing
- I've recently been adding agave syrup into the mix as well (equal parts brown,
  white, agave, and water by volume). It tempers the flavor away from super
  molasses-y. Super molasses-y is fine in a rich black tea but not as great in a
  light jasmine or oolong.

### Ingredients

- 1 cup dark brown sugar, packed
- 1 cup white (cane) sugar
- 1 cup water

### Instructions

- Combine the water and sugars in a small pot
- Heat and stir the mixture until everything is dissolved

# Black Milk Tea

### Notes

- Makes one 11 fl oz cup (excludes volume of ice and toppings)
- The Irish breakfast tea I linked is really malty, I think it makes for a
  hearty milk tea. It's not quite as subtle or smooth as Boba Guys for example.
- I've also tried making this recipe the same way with an Irish breakfast tea
  and also with a Scottish breakfast tea, both from Upton tea. In a taste test
  among my friends we all preferred the Irish breakfast, as it was maltier
  without being too bitter.

### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp [Irish breakfast black tea leaves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GA95AV4)
- 5 fl oz water
- 4 oz ice
- 2 fl oz [Straus Organic Half & Half](https://www.strausfamilycreamery.com/products/organic-half-and-half/)
- 2 tbsp [Boba Guys House Syrup](#boba-guys-house-syrup)

### Instructions

- Heat the water to 190°F
- Add the tea leaves, brew for 4 minutes
- Strain the brewed tea and leaves over the ice
- Let the ice melt completely
  - This will yield about 8 fl oz of tea
- Add the half & half
- Add the syrup
  - 2 tbsp is about 50% sweet. Use less or more syrup to taste.

# Jasmine Green Milk Tea

### Notes

- Makes one 10 fl oz cup (excludes volume of ice and toppings)
- I was never 100% attached to the tea I linked below, and it looks like it's
  out of stock now.
- There is less half & half in this compared to the black tea. That's to let the
  floral flavors of the tea shine through better.

### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp [Jasmine green tea leaves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UFVIBSW/)
- 5 fl oz water
- 4 oz ice
- 1 fl oz [Straus Organic Half & Half](https://www.strausfamilycreamery.com/products/organic-half-and-half/)
- 2 tbsp [Boba Guys House Syrup](#boba-guys-house-syrup)

### Instructions

- Heat the water to 170°F
- Add the tea leaves, brew for 2 minutes, 15 seconds
  - Unlike the other teas (black, oolong, etc.) I've found that the timing here
    is really essential
- Strain the brewed tea and leaves over the ice
- Let the ice melt completely
  - This will yield about 8 fl oz of tea
- Add the half & half
- Add the syrup
  - 2 tbsp is about 50% sweet. Use less or more syrup to taste.

# Tie Guan Yin Milk Tea

### Notes

- Makes one 10.5 fl oz cup (excludes volume of ice and toppings)
- I've found oolong to be really versatile. Once I accidentally let it steep for
  6 minutes and it didn't even taste that bad.

### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp [Tie Guan Yin tea leaves](https://www.amazon.com/Positively-Tea-Company-Organic-Oolong/dp/B01JAMJZG8)
- 5 fl oz water
- 4 oz ice
- 1.5 fl oz [Straus Organic Half & Half](https://www.strausfamilycreamery.com/products/organic-half-and-half/)
- 2 tbsp [Boba Guys House Syrup](#boba-guys-house-syrup)

### Instructions

- Heat the water to 180°F
- Add the tea leaves, brew for 4 minutes
- Strain the brewed tea and leaves over the ice
- Let the ice melt completely
  - This will yield about 8 fl oz of tea
- Add the half & half
- Add the syrup
  - 2 tbsp is about 50% sweet. Use less or more syrup to taste.
